\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to develop an application that adds another level of encryption to Dropbox. The attack model is confidentiality loss once data is uploaded to Dropbox. Using the Dropbox Public REST API we will encrypt uploaded data. To save on performance files will be divided into blocks, each of which are encrypted separately. After file modification only affected blocks will be altered. The focus of this project is confidentiality from Dropbox, active adversaries on the line, and/or government entities.
